Hello! My name is Chris and I really enjoy pretty much anything relating to computer science! Over the past year I have been learning a lot about it, specifically Cybersecurity and Programming.

I really enjoy both and have spent a lot of time learning more about them. I hope to share my experiences throughout the learning process though this blog. With the ammount of times that blogs similar to what I hope this will become has helped me I feel that it is only right that I give back to the community!
