In my last post I mentioned Keybase. For those of you who haven't heard of it before, Keybase is a online site which is working towards a more
secure internet. Keybase allows for you to easily link many accounts to one central hub allowing for others to be able to find you. However,
this also has another positive side effect. It allows for others to know these accounts actually belong to you if used correctly.
Keybase, like I said before is built off of the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption standard.
