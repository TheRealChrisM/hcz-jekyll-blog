  I've decided that it is finally time to use this website for more than just a link to old github projects. Hopefully this won't fall victim 
to the same fate as some of my other projects. *Ahem* Ticketing System *Ahem* Reguardless of my inability to follow through with many
projects I see this as not only a chance to journal on my experiences but also to express my thoughts and feelings on various things both 
in my personal life and related to the Cybersecurity industry.
  Over this last year I have made a lot of strong strides in my knowledge and experience in relation to the Cybersecurity field. One thing,
which I will likely cover in more depth later, that I really enjoyed was getting to participate in MetaCTF. Soon after that event, looking
for ways to gain further knowledge in the field I found out that Shmoocon was comming up! A highly exclusive event which the tickets sell
out at an incredible rate, like we are talking seconds as opposed to hours. Lucky for me, they offer a program to help students get the
chance to attend this awesome event! Better yet, it allows for them to attend the conference for free! Shmooze-A-Student has brought the 
opportunity for me to attend a conference that has placed itself along the ranks of other incredibly well known conferences such as DEFCon.
The past few months have brought me from a point that I have only dreamed of.
