Hello! This is the first of hopefully many other posts on this blog. I plan on talking about the many different things I have done or learned in my quest to learn more about Cyber Security and Programming. In terms of cybersecurity I have spent a lot of time with linux, more specifically Ubuntu. I have also been learning a lot about web development with hopes of becomming a full stack developer. So my experience in programming and computer security tend to blend together pretty well!
  I have worked on a decent ammount of projects, some I developed with github others not so much. However I do plan on posting all of them on my github page and allow for others to see and use them! I have also made a few scripts that I used to help make doing things like installing certain programs easier or saving time when using the bash shell which I also plan on making available on my github! I am really excited to get to give back to the community with how much I have gotten from blogs and tutorials very similar to what I hope to provide! Feel free to check out any of my other accounts on the upper left hand corner or follow me on keybase with @santa! I plan on writing a post about keybase and all that it offers pretty soon!
